# PD2-PerkDeckTemplates
A template perk deck mod for PAYDAY 2. This version is simple: it only requires [SuperBLT](https://superblt.znix.xyz/) (does not require BeardLib), loads a single localization file, and has simple upgrade values. The upgrades also don't currently do anything. This is essentially a structural template for a custom perk deck mod; if you want a working example, search [the perk decks category in ModWorkshop](https://modworkshop.net/g/payday-2?category=646).
